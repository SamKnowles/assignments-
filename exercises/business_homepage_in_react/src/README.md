Deinosuchus

Deinosuchus is an extinct genus related to the modern crocodiles and alligators that lived 80 to 73 million years ago. Although it was far larger than any of the modern species, it generally looked the same. Measuring up to 40 feet in length, Deinosuchus had large, sharp teeth capable of killing and eating sea turtles, fish and even large dinosaurs.

Dunkleosteus

Living in the Late Devonian period, about 380–360 million years ago, Dunkleosteus was a large hyper-carnivorous fish. Thanks to its terrifying size reaching up to 33 feet and weight of almost 4 tons, it was the apex predator of its time. The fish was heavily armored, which made it relatively slow but very powerful swimmer.

Smilodon

Native to North and South America during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 million – 10,000 years ago), Smilodon is the best known example of saber-toothed cats. It was a robustly built predator with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long and sharp upper Cannes. The largest species could weigh as much as 900 pounds.

Pelagornis Sandersi

Thanks to its wingspan estimated to be up to 24 feet, Pelargonis Sandersi is apparently the largest flying bird yet discovered. It is probable that the bird was able to fly only by hopping off cliff edges and spent much of its time over the ocean, where it relied on wind currents rising up from the ocean to keep it aloft. Although considered the largest flying bird, compared to pterosaurs such as Quetzalcoatlus with wingspans of up to almost 40 feet, it was still pretty moderate.

Gigantopithecus

Living between 9 million to 100,000 years ago in today Asia, Gigantopithecus was the largest ape on Earth. Standing up to 10 feet tall and weighing up to 1,200 pounds, the creature is believed to walk on all fours like modern gorillas and chimpanzees; however, a minority opinion favors bipedal, human-like locomotion. The features of its teeth and jaws suggest that the animal was adapted to chewing tough, fibrous food by cutting, crushing, and grinding it.

Andrewsarchus

Living during the Eocene epoch, some 45 to 36 million years ago, Andrewsarchus was a giant carnivorous mammal. Based on the founding of a skull and several bones, paleontologists suggest the predator might have weighed up to 4,000 pounds which would possibly make it the largest land-dwelling mammal predator ever. However, the behavioral patterns of this creature are not clear and some theories even indicate that Andrewsarchus could have been omnivorous or scavenger.

Helicoprion

One of the longest-lived pre-historical creatures (310 – 250 million years ago), Helicoprion is a genus of extinct, shark-like holocephalid fish most memorable for its spirally arranged clusters of teeth, called tooth whorls. Helicoprion may have grown up to over 13 feet long but its closest living relatives, the chimaeras can reach only 5 feet in length.

Quetzalcoatlus

With a wingspan of up to an incredible 40 feet, this giant pterosaur was the largest creature ever to fly, modern birds included. However, the size and mass estimates for these huge beasts are extremely problematic because no existing species share a similar size or body plan, and in consequence published results vary widely. One of the distinctive features common to all the specimens is an unusually long, stiffened neck.

Short-faced bear

The Short-faced bear is an extinct bear genus that inhabited North America during the Pleistocene epoch until 11,000 years ago, which makes him one of the “most recent“creatures of the list. Its size, however, is pre-historic indeed. Standing on its hind legs, it was up to 12 feet tall with 14 feet vertical arm reach. The short-faced bear is estimated to have weighed over 3,000 pounds.

Titanoboa

Living approximately 60–58 million years ago, during the Paleocene epoch, Titanoboa is the largest, longest, and heaviest snake ever discovered. Researchers estimate that the largest individuals could have a total length of around 42 feet and weighed about 2,500 pounds. Its diet usually consisted of giant crocodiles and turtles that shared its territory in today´s South America.

Cameroceras

Living during the Ordovician period, 470 to 460 million years ago, Cameroceras was a giant ancient ancestor of modern squids and octopi. The most distinctive feature of this mollusk was enormous cone-like shell and tentacles that it used for catching fish and other sea creatures. The estimates regarding the size of the shell vary greatly from 20 to 40 feet.

Carbonemys

Carbonemys is an extinct genus of giant turtle that lived some 60 million years ago, which means they survived the mass extinction that killed most dinosaurs. A fossil found in Colombia suggests it had a shell that measured almost 6 feet. The turtle was carnivorous with massive jaws and powerful enough to eat large animals such as crocodiles.
