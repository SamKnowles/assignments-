    <h2>Moon Severely Damaged by Total Solar Eclipse</h2>
    <h3>By Ralph E. Shaffer of <a href="http://www.thespoof.com" id="spoof">The Spoof!</a></h3>
    <p class="column"><img src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/750w/total-solar-eclipse.jpg?1">Mt. Palomar Observatory. Astronomers today confirmed what amateur moon gazers have been saying since late August: the moon is noticeably paler than it was before the total solar eclipse of Aug. 21. Offering an explanation devoid of scientific jargon, a spokesman for the observatory at Palomar explained that, <span class="highlight">"in simple terms, the moon suffered a sun burn."</span></p>     
    <p class="column">"During a total solar eclipse the moon is bombarded by molecules with a temperature too hot for our instruments to measure. <span class="highlight">The surface of the moon is essentially fried or blistered.</span> When seen on the first night following the eclipse, the moon looks less shiny to those on earth. That condition will gradually improve, bringing the moon back to its full brightness after several months. Any life on the moon, whether human or as yet undiscovered native plant or animal life, could only survive such an eclipse by remaining on the dark side of the orb facing earth during the eclipse."</p>
    <p class="column">This phenomenon had been suspected after previous solar eclipses and has inspired several popular songs and stories. Lyricists and fiction writers have linked a pale moon to romance, unaware that the paleness is the result of an unsurvivable natural condition. About the time of the solar eclipse in 1938, as an example, Hoagy Carmichael and Ned Washington composed <span class="song-title">"The Nearness of You,"</span> with the opening line "It's not the pale moon that excites me...." The Palomar astronomers predict that the color of the moon will return to normal by the beginning of the new year.</p>

    <h1>Snape? Good? Bad? Amazeballs?!?</h1>
    <h2>Alert! Woop Woop! Strap In Folks!</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <p class="column">The Death Eater
            On the outside, Severus <b>Snape</b> has "Death Eater" written all over him. Greasy, ill-tempered, batlike (we hope no one ever has to describe us as "batlike"), and perpetually frowny-faced, Professor really seems to fit the mold of the stereotypical villain. He's also notoriously anti-Harry; even though he doesn't appear to be trying to thwart Harry directly over the course of the previous six books, he certainly dislikes the boy. After killing Dumbledore at the end of Book 6, has us convinced that he's on Voldemort's side for sure. And in the beginning of Book 7, he seems like the worst of the Death Eaters when he blasts off George Weasley's ear. He's a convincing villain, and a seriously amazing double agent.
            <img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/290/698/c3e.jpg" alt="Snape">            
        </p>
        <p class="column">Double Agent
            However, the hidden <mark>Severus</mark> Snape is much more interesting. So many layers we hardly know where to begin!
            We only get to see the true Snape emerge right before he dies (the most tragic thing of all), but what we see in the Pensieve is a man completely different from what we expected, who's a far cry from the melodramatic, brooding stereotypical villain we thought he was. Though Snape has seemed to foster nothing but resentment, bitterness, and flat-out meanness, it turns out he's been motivated by the highest, best, most valuable qualities all along – love and loyalty. It's a huge surprise. Our feelings for Snape turn on a dime, just like Harry's do, as soon as we learn the truth about him; his love for Lily, proved beyond a shadow of a doubt by his doe Patronus, reveals a truly tragic, noble, and self-sacrificing character that we'll admit we never suspected.
            Knowing that Snape has been on the Dumbledore's side for all seven of the Harry Potter books reveals him as an extremely brave man and a truly skilled spy. Snape has had to face and deceive the terrifying Lord Voldemort constantly. In fact, Snape is so courageous that Dumbledore implies that maybe he should have been in Gryffindor: "I sometimes thing that we Sort too soon" (33.144).
            But we can't forget that Snape was, at one point, a true Death Eater. Though brave now, he once was not. Here's what Rowling has to say about the matter:
            Given his time over again [Snape] would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people (like Wormtail) he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive. […] He wanted Lily and he wanted Mulciber too. He never really understood Lily's aversion [to Mulicber and the Death Eaters]; he was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought she would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater. (source)           
            By the end of Book 7, Snape's character seems to make so much more sense. Learning about his rough family life and the bullying he suffered from in school, we can't help but feel for the guy and forgive him for being a confused, insecure young man. We end Chapter 33 wanting to give him a hug.
        </p>
        <p class="column">A Nice Guy?
            But let's take a step back, for a moment. Snape is definitely brave and admirable, but is he a nice guy? In his revealing chapter, "The Prince's Tale," we're totally touched by his unwavering love for Lily. But we can't ignore that fact that he unfairly hates Harry (who's just a kid, no less). The only reason he's been protecting Harry is out of his love for Lily. To put it simply, this is one complicated dude. In one interview, Rowling says, "I like [Snape], but I'd also like to slap him hard". Chuckle. She also comments:
            Snape is a complicated man. He's bitter. He's … spiteful. He's a bully. All these things are still true of Snape, even at the end of this book. But was he brave? Yes, immensely. […] Was he capable of love? Very definitely. So he's – he's a very – he was a flawed human being, like all of us.
            Harry forgives him – as we know, from the epilogue, Harry – Harry really sees the good in Snape ultimately. I wanted there to be redemption and I wanted there to be forgiveness. And Harry forgives, even knowing that until the end Snape loathed him unjustifiably. it's totally, totally unfair that he loathes him so much […]. (source)
            In the end, he's still the greasy, sour-tempered, sarcastic Snape we always knew him to be. Though he isn't really nice, he's completely set apart from someone like Voldemort by his ability to love, and it's his love that redeems him. He might not be someone we'd like to have for a housemate, but if we were waging a war against the Dark side, we'd definitely want him on our side.
